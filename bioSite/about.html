            <p>Roy grew up in Eugene Oregon. As a young child he wanted to be a professional baseball player. 
                During high school he got into weight lifting and decided he wanted to become a PE teacher and baseball coach. 
                As an adult Roy enjoyed skiing, playing pick up games of sports such as basketball and softball, and being with his family. 
                He learned to play the guitar in high school and still enjoys playing the guitar and singing with his kids. 
                He enjoys the simple things in life such as mowing the lawn, taking walks with his wife, and painting. As an adult, 
                he and his wife did foster care and adopted 8 children. His favorite sports teams are the Oregon Ducks for college football, 
                the Pittsburgh Steelers for professional football, and the Philadelphia Phillies for baseball. 
                Now he enjoys working on his farm and spending time with his grandkids.
